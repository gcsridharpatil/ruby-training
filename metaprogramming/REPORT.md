## Grades

### Following TDD principles - 0

F

You literally just copied a full solution, there is 0 iteration, refactoring or corrections

### Pass Rate

B

You unfortunately missed one of the tests out and returned the wrong value several times

### White box analysis

C

Code is reasonably clean, quite a bit of whitespace issues though

You also have an extra return

### Miscellaneous Criteria

C

It is not bad, but I can't grade higher than a C due to missing more than 1 commit

### Overall Grade

C

You just scraped a C, I would ensure you're following the task specification - This is the 3rd time
I have echoed this. Will chase this up with you in your 1-2-1's

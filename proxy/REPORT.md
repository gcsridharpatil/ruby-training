## Grades

### Following TDD principles

C

In principle I would score this a **B**. However you only completed one single iteration instead of the several
that were required.

### Pass Rate

D

The first 2 specs were completed, but then almost everything else through NME's or was simply not completed

Please speak to me if you're unsure what the question is asking

### White box analysis

C

The code definitely looks a bit better, has better alignment and has less redundancy

I still thinking basic linting is something you're not doing - please check your alignment and standard method
invocations as lots of silly little mistakes being made

### Miscellaneous Criteria

E

There are 2 commits in the entirety with little to no information on

Short of directly pushing with no information I couldn't grade this any worse. Please speak to me if you're
having issues with git

### Overall Grade

D

Quite a lot of this attempt was copied also from other peoples work. I'd prefer if you didn't blindly copy
from other peoples' forks as it doesn't show me what level you are at

# Report Grade - shapes

Report for Sridhar, for shapes project

## Grading Criteria

Each of the following points will be used
* Following TDD principles
    * Are you following TDD principles?
    * Did you write the minimum to make some tests pass and then improve?
    * Did you iterate on your work?
    * Did you do red-green-refactor?
* Pass Rate
    * Did your code pass when I ran it?
    * Did you follow the rules set out for completing the work?
* White box analysis
    * Is your code neat and tidy?
    * Is your code easy to understand / follow?
    * Does your code solve only the problem stipulated (i.e. you've not tried to over-engineer)?
* Miscellaneous Criteria
    * N/A

## Grades

### Following TDD principles
E

No TDD was attempted. All solutions were just provided AS IS, which directly contravened the purpose of the exercise.

Furthermore, a few limited attempts were made to try cover errors after the fact, but nothing that showed
any TDD had been attempted.

### Pass Rate
C

A Bunch of tests failed that were expected to pass. Furthermore the tests themselves were edited.

This probably should have scored a B, but given some of the files were modified and that was against the scope
of the exercise, a C is awarded to reference the fact that the specification of the code has been altered
(This directly contravenes good software development)

### White box analysis
E

Outside of polygon angles, the code is very cumbersome, it has lots of linting errors (Invalid variables/tabbing).

Polygon angles itself has some reasonable steps made, but again there are a few steps that are quite poor. There is
also some extra error handling which again contradicts the spec

### Miscellaneous Criteria
N/A - Not being used for this project

### Overall Grade
D

I would focus on trying to ensure the problem is solved and TDD is done. This will enable you to improve.

Quite a few areas were very clunky, and consequently this made a few of the tests fail.

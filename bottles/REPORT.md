# Report Grade - Bottles

Report for Sridhar, for the Bottles project

## Grading Criteria

Each of the following points will be used
* Following TDD principles - **30%**
  * Are you following TDD principles?
  * Did you write the minimum to make some tests pass and then improve?
  * Did you iterate on your work?
  * Did you do red-green-refactor in the correct places?
* Pass Rate - **25%**
  * Did your code pass when I ran it?
  * Did you follow the rules set out for completing the work?
* White box analysis - **30%**
  * Is your code neat and tidy?
  * Is your code easy to understand / follow?
  * Does your code solve only the problem stipulated (i.e. you've not tried to over-engineer the solution?)
  * Have you removed all redundant code
* Miscellaneous Criteria - **15%**
  * Git commit history (Easy to understand / follow)
  * Incremental working through `skip`

## Grades

### Following TDD principles

D

Still very hard to follow any of the TDD principles. It feels as though you did all the red, then all the
green, then all the refactor. The final 5 or so commits are all completely rewriting your approach, twice by
the looks of things.

The final work almost looks night and day from the original submission. So much so that it looks as if the
final solution was taken from elsewhere because the style looks completely different too. It's hard to see
an evolution from the start to the finish for the code.

### Pass Rate

B

Whilst all the code does pass. The evolution to get from start to end was very messy and went against most of
the principles we asked for. Need to ensure you don't modify the test files.

### White box analysis

A

The code is flawless and very easy to understand. There is a small amount of optimisations / redundant code
that can be removed, but it is definitely the most complete solution.

### Miscellaneous Criteria

B

The git commit history is much improved from previous attempts. However the working through skip is very clumsy
and as such I cannot give this an A. Also there is a little bit of back and forth with the working through skip.

### Overall Grade

You just scraped a B here. Well done, but I do feel like there is still an awful lot of improvement to be made.

Also I would be wary if you have just copied large portions from the web as it won't help you when the problem
is something that isn't readily available.

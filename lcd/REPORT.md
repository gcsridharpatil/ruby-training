# Report Grade - LCD

Report for Sridhar, for the LCD project

## Grading Criteria

Each of the following points will be used
* Following TDD principles - **35%**
  * Are you following TDD principles?
  * Did you write the minimum to make some tests pass and then improve?
  * Did you iterate on your work?
  * Did you do red-green-refactor for the suggested steps provided in the README?
  * Did you do red-green-refactor once it came to the stretch goals?
* Pass Rate - **15%**
  * Did you follow the rules set out for completing the work?
  * Did you pass the `lcd_numbers_spec.rb` in its entirety?
  * Did you pass all tests?
* White box analysis - **45%**
  * Is your code neat and tidy?
  * Is your code easy to understand / follow?
  * Does your code solve only the problem stipulated (i.e. you've not tried to over-engineer the solution?)
  * Have you removed **all** redundant code
* Miscellaneous Criteria - **5%**
  * Git commit history (Easy to understand / follow)

## Grades

### Following TDD principles

E

Whilst there wasn't a lot of material here (Just 3 commits). It is starting to be more noticeable that the
effort and learning you're doing is reaping rewards (Reading the commits is a **lot** easier now)

However on further analysis it does seem as though some of the commit messages don't strictly speaking
match up to the delivered work available in the SHA. So I would still say there's a lot to do here

As there was no real evidence of refactoring, it was just rinse / repeat, and there was a lot of copying
from work submitted by Bargavi, I can't really give you a strong grade here

### Pass Rate

D

You followed the rules partially, and completed part of the spec for the numbers (Basic ones were the only
ones that passed)

A lot of errors were generated in your code, specifically NME's e.t.c. which is why I imagine the multi-digit
numbers didn't work

### White box analysis

D

In terms of hitting the bullet points requested, almost none are hit to the level we should be hitting now

- Neatness / Tidiness: There's too much erratic behaviour going on with variables and syntax)
- Easy to understand / follow: In parts it is, but much of your explanation doesn't marry up (Code works 
sometimes by accident)
- Over-engineering: You didn't really over-engineer the solution, but likewise the solution isn't really solved
at all in the correct way
- Removal of redundant code: This wasn't done, but at the state you were at, this wasn't applicable.

### Miscellaneous Criteria

C

Git commits were better, but still nowhere near the standard they should be. Also your merging still is throwing
up a few mistakes

### Overall Grade

D

Speak to me if some areas aren't making sense. But given we've about completed the course we will be soon
moving onto actual work
